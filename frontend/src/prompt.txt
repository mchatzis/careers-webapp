I am building a job site in React, using Tailwind for the styling.
The site is a single-page application. It is fairly simple. There are
two components that comprise the application. They are stacked horizontally
from top to bottom. The top component should be a search bar with two input fields, 
one for job title and one for location and a button for initiating the search. 

Design the form input fields.
